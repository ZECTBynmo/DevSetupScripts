This is a series of batch files that I drop into my system32 folder whenever I'm setting up a PC. They setup keyboard shortcuts for the windows command line.

Here's a quick description of the functionality of the scripts

* p - Navigates to my project directory (D:/Projects)
* open - opens the folder in Sublime Text 2 and windows explorer
